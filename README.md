# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
(Fill in your description and goals here: 

1.) Connect your data
2.) Detect different data types in your data
3.) Build at least 5 different visualizations to learn more about the dataset.
4.) There are three main different categorical features in the table. Try to learn more about these categories and find appropriate numerical features to study different trends in them.
Room Type
Beds
Price
Neighbourhood
Host Since
5.) In your final project presentation, you should show visualizations with:
Maps
Date and time
Analytical visuals (Forecasting - Clustering)
Show Me tables
6.) Try to find an interesting pattern, trend, outlier, etc. from the data used in the above steps.
From step 5, try to detect meaningful keypoints. This is the starting point to think about your dashboard.
Now that you are familiar with your dataset and your columns, in this step, come up with different questions which you will be answering and presenting at the end of this project
7.) Create the dashboard to answer your questions that you came up with in step 8 and try to revise your questions along the way.
8.) Present your dashboard)
