# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
(Fill in your description and goals here: To try to find interesting pattern, trend, outlier, try to find meaningful keypoints and try to find different data from data set. And create graphs/tables/maps to help understand the data)

## Process
### (Step 1) Connect your data 
### (Step 2) Detect different data types in your data 
### (Step 3) Build at least 5 different visualizations to learn more about the dataset. 
### (Step 4) The table has three main different categorical features. Try to learn more about these categories and find appropriate numerical features to study different trends in them. Room Type Beds Price Neighbourhood Host Since 
### (Step 5) In your final project presentation, you should show visualizations with: Maps Date and time Analytical visuals (Forecasting - Clustering) Show Me tables 
### (Step 6)Try to find an interesting pattern, trend, outlier, etc. from the data used in the above steps. From step 5, try to detect meaningful keypoints. This is the starting point to think about your dashboard. Now that you are familiar with your dataset and your columns, in this step, come up with different questions which you will be answering and presenting at the end of this project 
### (Step 7) Create the dashboard to answer your questions that you came up with in step 8 and try to revise your questions along the way. 
### (Step 8) Present your dashboard)


## Results
(Fill in which Option you chose, either 1 or 2. List the dataset you selected for the project if you selected Option 2. Also, discuss the visualizations you created, and why. For Option 2, also identify what your data question was, and how you went through the prompts.)

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)

## Future Goals
(If I had more time I would go more in depth with finding more patterns, outliers, keypoints as well as creating more detailed graphs/tables/maps.)
